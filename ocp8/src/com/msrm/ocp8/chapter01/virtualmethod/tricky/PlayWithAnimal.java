 * The correct answer is toss in meat. The main method creates a new Lion and
 * calls careFor. Since only the Animal superclass has a careFor method, it
 * executes. That method calls play. Java looks for overridden methods, and it
 * sees that Lion implements play. Even though the call is from the Animal
 * class, Java still looks at subclasses, which is good because you donâ€™t want
 * to pet a Lion!
